				<article class="col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-lg-4">Game of Thrones is an American
					fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff and D. B.
					Weiss. It is an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, George R. R.
					Martin's series of fantasy novels, the first of which is titled A
					Game of Thrones. The series is set on the fictional continents of
					Westeros and Essos and interweaves several plot lines with a large
					ensemble cast.</article>
				<article class="col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-lg-4">The first narrative arc follows
					a dynastic conflict among competing claimants for succession to the
					Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms, with other noble families
					fighting for independence from it; the second covers the attempts
					to reclaim the throne by the exiled last scion of the realm's
					deposed ruling dynasty; the third chronicles the rising threat of
					the impending winter and the legendary creatures and fierce peoples
					of the North.</article>
				<article class="col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-lg-4">Like the novels it adapts, Game
					of Thrones has a sprawling ensemble cast, estimated to be the
					largest on television. During the production of the third season,
					257 cast names were recorded. In 2014, several of the actors'
					contracts were renegotiated to include the option for a seventh
					season, and included raises that reportedly made the cast among the
					best-paid on cable TV.</article>

				<article class="col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-lg-4">A White Walker is an
					otherworldly humanoid creature from the HBO television series Game
					of Thrones, and the George R. R. Martin novel series A Song of Ice
					and Fire on which it is based. Primarily referred to as the Others
					in the novels, White Walkers are a supernatural threat to mankind
					who dwell outside the Westeros, north of The Wall.</article>
				<article class="col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-lg-4">Martin introduces the Others in
					the prologue of A Game of Thrones, describing them as "Tall ... and
					gaunt and hard as old bones, with flesh pale as milk" with eyes
					"deeper and bluer than any human eyes, a blue that burned like
					ice". Accompanied by intense cold, they wear armor that "seemed to
					change color as it moved", and wield thin crystal swords capable of
					shattering steel. The Others move silently, and they speak their
					own language; Martin writes that their voices are "like the
					cracking of ice on a winter lake". In A Storm of Swords it becomes
					clear that they are vulnerable to weapons made of dragonglass
					(obsidian), as Samwell Tarly kills one this way.</article>
				<article class="col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-lg-4">Creatures killed by the Others
					soon reanimate as wights: undead with pallid skin, black hands and
					similarly glowing blue eyes. Dragonglass and Valyrian steel have no
					effect on them. Wights may be physically injured, but even
					dismembered parts remain animated, so they must be destroyed by
					fire. The humans who live in the north beyond The Wall—called
					"wildlings" by the inhabitants of Westeros—burn their dead so that
					they do not become wights.</article>

					"and Joanna Lannister, who dies giving birth to him. "+
					"Tyrion's elder sister Cersei is the Queen of Westeros by virtue of "+
					"her marriage to King Robert Baratheon, and Cersei's male twin Jaime is "+
					"one of the Kingsguard, the royal security detail. "+
					"Described as an ugly (for all the world like a gargoyle), "+
					"malformed dwarf with mismatched green and black eyes, "+
					"Tyrion possesses the pale blond hair of a Lannister but has "+
					"a complicated relationship with the rest of them. "+
					"While he is afforded the privilege and luxuries of his family, "+
					"he is treated as a \"second class noble\" because of his stature. "+
					"Additionally, Tyrion's mother Joanna had died giving birth to him, "+
					"and Tywin and Cersei loathe him because they blame him for her death. "+
					"While Tywin bears no affection for Tyrion, "+
					"he nevertheless feels a sense of duty to his son, "+
					"raising him in the Lannister fold and extending Tyrion a share of the family wealth. "+
					"In contrast to Tywin and Cersei, Jaime has great affection for Tyrion, "+
					"and treats him with kindness, respect, friendship and love."},	
					{name:"Arya Stark",
					info:"Arya is the younger daughter of Lord Eddard Stark and his wife Lady Catelyn Stark. "+
					"She is headstrong, independent, disdains traditional female pursuits, "+

					"a gift from her half-brother, Jon Snow, "+
					"and is trained in the Braavosi style of sword fighting."},
					{name:"Jon Snow",
					info:"Jon is described as having strong Stark features with a lean build, "+
					"long face, dark brown hair and grey eyes. Jon has the surname \"Snow\" "+
					"(customarily used for illegitimate children in the North) "+
					"and is resented by Ned's wife Catelyn, who views him as a constant reminder "+
					"of Ned's infidelity. Jon is the same age as Robb and enjoys a warm relationship "+
					"with his siblings, particularly the tomboy Arya "+
					"(who resembles Jon and like him does not feel like she fits in). "+
					"Ned treats Jon as much like his other children as propriety and his honor will allow. "+
					"Still, as somewhat of an outsider, "+
					"Jon has learned to be independent and to fend for himself when necessary. "+
					"Jon idolizes his father, but is wounded by Ned's refusal to tell him about his mother."},
					{name:"Jaime Lannister",
					info:"Jaime was born shortly after the birth of his twin sister Cersei. "+
					"The two were inseparable as children, "+
					"and at an early age began an incestuous affair that continued into adulthood "+
					"and even after Cersei's marriage to Robert Baratheon. "+
					"At the age of fifteen he participated in the battle against the Kingswood Brotherhood, "+
					"squiring for Lord Sumner Crakehall, and was subsequently knighted by Ser Arthur Dayne. "+
					"While returning to Casterly Rock, he visited Cersei at King's Landing, "+
					"who persuaded him to join the Kingsguard in order to be close to Cersei. "+
					"Jaime was accepted into the Kingsguard, but Tywin resigned as Hand of the King, "+
					"taking Cersei with him back to Casterly Rock. "+
					"Jaime quickly realises that Aerys named him to the Kingsguard solely to strip "+
					"Tywin of his heir. Jaime becomes further disillusioned after witnessing "+
					"Aerys burn Rickard and Brandon Stark alive and overhearing him raping his "+
					"sister-wife Rhaella. When Tywin begins sacking King's Landing at the climax of "+
					"Robert's Rebellion, Jaime realises that Aerys intends to burn King's Landing "+
					"with wildfire and kills him, almost immediately being discovered by Tywin's men. "+
					"Robert Baratheon later pardons Jaime for breaking his vows and names him to his "+
					"own Kingsguard. Although Jaime considers his assassination of "+
					"Aerys as his greatest act, his motives for killing him remain unknown to the "+
					"rest of the realm and he is given the insulting moniker \"Kingslayer\"."},
					{name:"Daenerys Targaryen",
					info:"Daenerys Targaryen is the daughter of King Aerys II Targaryen "+

					"Daenerys was born in the midst of a great storm, earning her the nickname 'Stormborn'. "+
